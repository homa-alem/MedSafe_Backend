It is intended to control or assist breathing by delivering room air to the patient. It utilizes an internal compressor to generate compressed air for delivery to the patient. Breath delivery is controlled by software algorithms. The PL VC I user interface has a membrane keypad with indicator Light Emitting Diodes for the selection and acceptance of patient settings and for the display of alarm conditions. PL VC I provides the following types of ventilatory support:1) Positive Pressure Ventilation; delivered either invasively (via endotracheal or tracheostomy tube) or non-invasively (via mask or mouthpiece ).2) Assist/Control; Spontaneous Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) modes of ventilation.3) Volume-Controlled (VC).

Customers were instructed to safely plan and transition patients in their care from the PLV Continum Ventilator onto to other comparable patient support devices. If customers did not have a suitable ventilator to use for their patients, Respironics will loan them a PLV 100, 102 or 102b Ventilator with no charge. If patient support goes beyond the capabilities of the PLV 100, 102, or 102b Ventilator is required, Respironics will make arrangements to loan the customer with a suitable substitute rental ventilator at no charge.

The notification letter (URGENT:  Product Correction) will advise of two situations that could cause the STERRAD 100S Sterilizer to malfunction.  The first situation involves the failure of the STERRAD 100S System to detect when an injection takes place without hydrogen peroxide having been transferred to the vaporizer bowl. This can occur under combinations of the following conditions:

- the pneumatic pressure is low on the machine, or

- the injector valve has a small leak,

AND

- a cassette fails to advance, or

- a used cassette is re-inserted into the sterilizer.



This situation can result in a cycle completion with insufficient hydrogen peroxide.  The second situation involves the failure of the STERRAD 100S System to detect an obstruction in the door travel path while the door is closing. Under some conditions, the door sensors may become mechanically unsecured/disconnected and will not detect an obstruction. This situation

can result in an operator's hand becoming pinched and bruised while the door is closing.  To correct both situations above, Advanced Sterilization Products(ASP) has revised the software and is making physical hardware additions to the STERRAD 100S System.

The catheter delivers RF power in a monopolar mode between its distal electrode and the DIP electrode. The Generator incorporates a medical grade power supply. This power supply can be used for various line voltages and frequencies without any modifications. Utilizing microprocessor control; the Generator produces a continuous nonmodulated radio frequency (RF) output at 485 KHz. Its front panel displays the command power output; tissue impedance; and tissue temperature. The Generator measures root-mean-square (RMS) voltage; RMS current; and command power output by taking the average value of the product of voltage and current. This reflects the effective heating power delivered to the tissue from the catheter large electrode (tip electrode or other ablating electrodes). Impedance is calculated as RMS voltage divided by RMS current. The amount and duration of RF power delivery is user- selectable. The Generator has four (4) independent channels for monitoring the tissue temperature simultaneously using thermocouple sensor and i-channel (thermistor) for catheters using a thermistor sensor. The desired temperature is user-selectable when busing a catheter with a temperature sensor. If using a catheter with a temperature sensor; the output power of the Generator will shut off if the measured temperature exceeds 80C or if the measured temperature exceeds the user-selected temperature set point by more than 5C for greater than 3 seconds. If using a catheter with 4 temperature sensors; the output power of the Generator will shut off when the highest temperature detected from anyone of the temperature sensors is exceeds the preset temperature by more than 5C for greater than 3 seconds or exceeding 80C.The Generator has built-in safety features which include automatic RF power shutoff if the measured tissue impedance falls below 50 ohms or exceeds 300 ohms or the preset impedance value.,St Jude Medical,2,The recall was initiated because St. Jude Medical has confirmed its T14 and T12 RF Generatormay malfunction upon encountering an unexpected electric current (e.g. static electricity).The resulting 'malfunction results in a failure of the generator to respond to key pressesproperly; and may cause unexpected energy delivery or inability to discontinue energydelivery with the start / stop but,Hardware,Device Operation,"The firm, St. Jude Medical (SJM), sent a ""Product Correction"" letter dated May 9, 2011 to it's affected customers.

Use Sample Drawn Date and Date of Birth information available at your LIS in lieu of the analyzer transmitted fields BIRTH and UDATE.

Use the current date when the results are received at the LIS in lieu of the transmitted Run Date [DATE]. Print results from the Workstation to keep a copy of the analysis date on the analyzer, if necessary.

Use the control expiration date from the analyzer display or printout.

ACTION FOR ISSUE 2:

If you use the LIS 1G1 transmission format, use the General Information group field names in place of the Retic Parameter group field names to identify each reticulocyte run (see Table in Issue 2 section).

Check with your LIS vendor to determine if it is possible to switch to the LH 750 Workstation transmission format. Format requirements are LIS driver specific.
